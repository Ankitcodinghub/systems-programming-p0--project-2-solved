1 Hashassin

Now that we have some basics of hashing, etc. down, we are going to make a full blown rainbow table implementation. You can accept the GitHub classroom assignment at https://classroom.github.com/a/nZLy9P4v. Assignment Project Exam Help

2 Instructions

As with Project 1, your binary crate should be in a directory called cli and it should compile to a binary named hashassin.

Your library crate should be in a directory called core and it should be available called hashassin-core and usable by other crates via use hashassin core::Whatever.

Your CLI will will support several additional commands: 1) gen-rainbow-table, 2) crack, and 3) server.

gen-rainbow-table will generate a rainbow table with chains starting from a list of preexisting passwords. gen-rainbow-table must have several options that can be set:

1. ‚Äìnum-links, which specifies the number of links generated chains should have. ‚Äìnum-links must be greater than zero and should have a default value of 5.

2. ‚Äìthreads, the number of threads to use when generating the rainbow table (format specified below).

3. ‚Äìout-path, which is where the generated rainbow table should be saved.

4. ‚Äìthreads, the number of threads to use to generate passwords. This value must be greater than zero and the maximum value should be the maximum length of an array on whatever system the program is being run on. ‚Äìthreads must have a default value of 1.

5. ‚Äìpassword-length, which is number of characters in the passwords for this rainbow table. ‚Äìpassword-length must be greater than zero and have a default value of 4.

6. ‚Äìalgorithm, the hashing algorithm that should be used for this rainbow table. ‚Äìalgorithm should have a default value of md5 (i.e., the default hashing algorithm should be md5).

By default, the valid character set for passwords is the same as Project 1: valid ASCII, both caps and lower case, and including punctuation and spaces but not including non-printable characters like newline or tabs or bells.

The on disk format for your rainbow table must (by default) have the start and end points of each chain, separated by a tab, with one chain per line.

For example, a rainbow table for 8 character passwords using md5:

6_wUZNF hATA!Kpk

Dni_2/TU ZBFUpjZw v~y^2i$e Yy(7.I44

where

is the ASCII tab character.

NB: You can add additional functionality that can restrict or expand the set of characters to be used in generated passwords, but by default, generated passwords should adhere to the above guidelines.

crack will, given a hash, produce the password corresponding to that hash using a pre-computed rainbow table. crack must have several options that can be set:

1. ‚Äìrainbow-table, which specifies the path to read the rainbow table from.

2. ‚Äìout-path, which, if present, will write the output of the command to the specified file, with one pair of hash hex encoded and corresponding password separated by the tab character, per line,. If not present, results should be written to stdout

3. ‚Äìthreads, the number of threads to use to crack a password. This value must be greater than zero and the maximum value should be the maximum length of an array on whatever system the program is being run on. ‚Äìthreads must have a default value of 1.

4. ‚Äìalgorithm, the hashing algorithm to use. ‚Äìalgorithm must have a default value of md5.

5. ‚Äìnum-links, which specifies the number of links generated chains should have. ‚Äìnum-links must be greater than zero and should have a default value of 5.

6. ‚Äìpassword-length, which is number of characters in the passwords for this rainbow table. ‚Äìpassword-length must be greater than zero and have a default value of 4.

7. ‚Äìin-path, which is a path to a set of hashes to crack.. The input path must (by default) have hashes stored as contiguous bytes. NB: This is somewhat different than project 1 where we stored hashes one per line.

You are free to add other options and functionality, but whatever you add should not be required to be set by a user. I.e., it should either be optional or have sensible defaults.

By default, the valid character set for passwords is the same as Project 1: valid ASCII, both caps and lower case, and including punctuation and spaces but not including non-printable characters like newline or tabs or bells.Assignment Project Exam Help

Output should be hex encoded hash and its corresponding password, separated by a tab character, with one pair per line.

server will provide a multi-user, interactive version of crack. server must have several options that can be set:

1. ‚Äìhost, which sets the IP address the server should listen on. Host must be a valid IP address and should default to 127.0.0.1.

2. ‚Äìport, which sets the port the server should listen on. Host must be a valid port and should default to 4515.

3. ‚Äìrainbow-table, which is a path to a rainbow table the server will be using.

4. ‚Äìalgorithm, which is the algorithm that should be used for hashing and should default to md5.

5. ‚Äìpassword-length, which must be greater than zero and corresponds to the length of passwords.

6. ‚Äìthreads, the number of threads to use for commands run by users. This value must be greater than zero and the maximum value should be the maximum length of an array on whatever system the program is being run on. ‚Äìthreads must have a default value of 1.

Additionally, server should allow clients to interact with it in the following way:

1. CRACK hash where hash is a hex encoded. This command should produce the associated password for the given hex encoded hash, in the same way that the crack command line does. If no password is found the user should be returned the message ‚ÄúPassword not found.‚Äù

server must allow multiple clients to connect and interact at the same time!

3 Grading

‚Ä¢ -1,000 points: If you do not update CREDITS.md with the names of your group members, as well as an honest break down of the work each group member did, you will receiveAssignment Project Exam HelpNEGATIVE

ONE THOUSAND points. I.e., it would be next to impossible to get anything higher than a zero on this project.

‚Ä¢ 15 points: All required functionality of gen-rainbow-table is implemented (e.g., setting ‚Äìthreads actually uses multiple threads, etc.)

‚Ä¢ 15 points: All required functionality of crack is implemented (e.g., setting ‚Äìthreads actually uses multiple threads, etc.).

‚Ä¢ 15 points: All required functionality of server is implemented (e.g., setting ‚Äìthreads actually uses multiple threads, etc.).

‚Ä¢ 5 points: Comprehensive documentation. Points will be determined by looking at the documentation built when running cargo doc ‚Äìdocument-private-items ‚Äìno-deps.

‚Ä¢ 10 points: No warnings from cargo check with no use of directives that would suppress default warnings (e.g., #[allow(dead code)])

‚Ä¢ 10 points: No warnings from cargo clippy with no use of directives that would suppress default warnings (e.g., #[allow(dead code)])

‚Ä¢ 5 points: REQUIRED FOR GRADUATE GROUPS. Support Sha256

‚Ä¢ 0.25 points: Support additional hashing algorithms besides md5 (0.25 points per algorithm)

‚Ä¢ 5 points: REQUIRED FOR GRADUATE GROUPS. You support passwords that are longer than 128 bits. I.e., you must have a reduction function that operates on arbitrary precision integers instead of just primitive types (e.g., u128).

‚Ä¢ 5 points: REQUIRED FOR GRADUATE GROUPS. Proper error handling. Create and use proper error types in library code and appropriate handling in any user code (e.g., CLI).

‚Ä¢ 5 points: No unwraps or expects. Add #![deny(clippy::unwrap used, clippy::expect used)] to the top of your main.rs and lib.rs. If running cargo clippy doesn‚Äôt result in any errors, then you get the 5 points.

‚Ä¢ 5 points: Add proper logging. Using the tracing crate to generate logs. Points will be determined on comprehensiveness of logs, as well as the usage of different log levels.

‚Ä¢ 10 points: REQUIRED FOR GRADUATE GROUPS. Performance report. Create a report that shows the performance characteristics of your program. E.g., how does it scale with respect to length of passwords? What performance differences are there between md5 and sha256 (and any other algorithms you might test)? How does threading affect performance? This report is not expected to be massive, but it should explain your experimental setup and have plots. The report is not required to conform to any particular formatting, but please try to make it look decent.Assignment Project Exam Help

points. Be sure to point out anything we should pay special attention to in your README.md file.

In addition to the above, you must have a README.md to summarize what you did and give any and all instructions on how to run things! I‚Äôm going to go off what‚Äôs in the README.md to grade, so make sure you tell us everything you did and test all the instructions, etc.

3.1 Allowed Crates

Generally speaking, you are free to use any crates listed on https://blessed.rs.

You can (and probably should) also use the hex crate (https://docs.rs/hex/latest/hex/index. html) as well as the num crate (https://docs.rs/num/latest/num/).

You can also use the async-channel crate (https://docs.rs/async-channel/latest/async_ channel/) if you are going to go for the async server points.

Any additional crates not on Blessed.rs need to be approved by Jeremy.

Be sure to note what crates you use in your README.md!

REMEMBER THAT IF YOU USE A MACHINE LEARNING TOOL THAT IS CHEATING, YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO ON THE PROJECT (i.e., your max grade in the class willAssignment Project Exam Helpbe a 66%, which is an F), AND THE CLASS WILL REVERT TO IN
